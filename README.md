# Auto-Unrar-Video-File

This script will scan a directory for any unnecessary video files and delete them.  Then it will scan for any .rar files and if any .rar files are found it will unrar them.  It will then move the video file to a complete directory.  If only a video file is found it will move the video file to the complete directory.  From there it will delete remaining files and directory.

# Setup

1.  Edit the directories in config.php and the many directories in unrar.php to fit your needs or just setup your directories as I have them.
